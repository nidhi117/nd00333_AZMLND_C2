##Project Oveview

This project was all about deploying ML models using Azure Platform. We learnt to deploy, authenticate, create and check logs, and use deployed model as the REST API.

##Ways to improve model

* Can set a greater time out limit of experiment so that it can try more algos.
* Can use deep learning (Enable deep learning checkbox) for classification problems.


##Key Steps
* Dataset creation
